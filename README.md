# Image-Gallery-With-Search
This project is a simple Responsive Image Gallery where users can search for images by typing the name of the image or clicking on a search icon. The gallery filters and displays images based on the entered search criteria. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive and responsive web page.
